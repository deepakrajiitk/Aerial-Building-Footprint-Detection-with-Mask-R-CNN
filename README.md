## Project Overview

This project demonstrates an advanced computer vision solution for accurately detecting and segmenting building footprints from aerial drone images using Mask R-CNN. The solution leverages deep learning techniques to enhance urban analysis through precise building structure identification.

## Features

- Utilized Mask R-CNN architecture for building footprint detection and segmentation.
- Curated a specialized dataset of aerial images and annotations for model training.
- Achieved an accuracy rate exceeding 85% through fine-tuning and customization.
- Configured custom data loading, augmentation strategies, and rigorous validation methods.
- Developed functions for scalable inference on multiple images and single large images.
- Leveraged geospatial data handling skills to contribute to geographic analysis and urban planning.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/deepakrajiitk/Aerial-Building-Footprint-Detection-with-Mask-R-CNN.git
   cd Aerial-Building-Footprint-Detection

2. Install the required Python packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Results
   - Trained model achieved an accuracy rate of over 85% in identifying building footprints.
   - Successfully visualized detected instances on multiple images and single large images.
   - Contributed to geographic analysis and urban planning through accurate building footprint detection.
